# Movie Recommender (AI + Python Practice)

## Overview

This project is a starting point to help me understand Artificial Intelligence concepts and get familiar with Python.  
It focuses on building a simple movie recommender system as a practical way to explore how AI can be applied.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13.7
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## Features

- Load a sample dataset of movies
- Implement a basic recommender (e.g., popularity-based or random)
- Experiment with similarity-based recommendations (content-based filtering)
- Expand with more AI/ML techniques as learning progresses
